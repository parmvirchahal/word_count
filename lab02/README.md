# Introduction

*Assigned: 2016-01-20*

*Due: 2016-01-29 11:59:59 PM EST*

This is the Lab 2 assignment for ECE 1120 - C Programming for ECE.

The goals of this lab are to introduce you to different C types,
arithmetic, and printing.

**Be sure to put your name in a comment at the top of each program you
write.**

# Steps

## Prelude: Use git to clone the Lab 2 assignment.

***Make sure you are inside your assignments folder.***

From the cloud9 command-line, use the git source code control tool to
make a copy of the starter source code for this assignment.

```
git clone https://github.com/gw-ece1120-s2016/lab02
```

You should see some output similar to this:
```
Cloning into 'lab02'...
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

#### Do some house keeping before proceeding

Remove .git folder from the assignment:

```
$ rm -rf lab02/.git
```

Make sure git tracks your progress on the assignment:

```
$ git add lab02/*
```

These steps are crucial for correct submission. We are not responsible for worng submissions, therefore please feel free to ask TA for clarification or confirmation.

## Part 1

Write a program called `part1.c` that declares and initializes two
integer variables `x` and `y` with the values `35` and `14`, and
displays and calculates their sum, product, integer quotient, integer
remainder and floating-point division quotient. Note modulus operator
in C, `%` which computes the integer remainder operator may be new to
you.


The output should exactly look like this:
```
35 + 14 = 49
35 * 14 = 490
35 // 14 = 2
35 % 14 = 7
35 / 14 = 22.500000
```

In order to produce this output, use printf to display text
combined with values of variables!

If you change the initial values of `x` and `y`, you should only have
to modify this in a single place in the program.

Add a comment to explain what you had to do in order to do
floating-point division, and why it was necessary.

When you are done with this part make sure git tracks this file. Run following command form inside lab02 folder:
```
git add part1.c
```

## Part 2

Copy the previous program into a file called `part2.c`. 

In this copy, modify the values of `x` and `y` to `a=123456789` and
`b=1000`. Run the program and explain the results in a comment. Do the
modifications needed in order to get the correct result.

When you are done with this part make sure git tracks this file. Run following command form inside lab02 folder:
```
git add part2.c
```

## Part 3

Write a program called `part3.c` that declares a variable named letter
of type `char` and initializes it with the constant 'C'.

Print this variable as a character *and* as an integer.  Add the
following statement: `letter=letter+1;` Print the updated value for
variable letter, as a character and as an integer, explain the result
in comment.

When you are done with this part make sure git tracks this file. Run following command form inside lab02 folder:
```
git add part3.c
```

## Part 4 -- Floating-point Precision

Write a program called `part4.c` with the following contents. Run it
and add a comment to explain the output.

```
#include <stdio.h>

/* ECE1120 - Lab 2 part 4
 * by Your Name Here.
 */

int main(void)
{
	double a, b;
	b = 2.0e20 + 1.0;
	a = b - 2.0e20;
	printf("%f \n", a);
	return 0;
}

```

When you are done with this part make sure git tracks this file. Run following command form inside lab02 folder:
```
git add part4.c
```

## Part 5 -- Floating-point Overflow

Write a program called `part5.c` with the following contents. Run it
and add a comment to explain the output.

```
#include <stdio.h>

/* ECE1120 - Lab 2 part 5
 * by Your Name Here.
 */

int main(void)
{
	double number = 3.4E307;
	printf("number is %e\n", number);
	number=number * 10000.0;
	printf("number multiplied by 10000 is %e\n", number);
	return 0;
}

```

When you are done with this part make sure git tracks this file. Run following command form inside lab02 folder:
```
git add part5.c
```


## Part 6 -- Simple Calculator (30 points)

Write a program called `part6.c` with the following contents.

```
#include <stdio.h>

/* ECE1120 - Lab 2 part 6
 * by Your Name Here.
 */

int main(void)
{
	int x, y;
	char c;

	printf("enter first number:\n");
	scanf("%d", &x);
	printf("the first number is %d\n", x);

	printf("enter second number:\n");
	scanf("%d", &y);
	printf("the second number is %d\n", y);

	printf("enter a character:\n");
	scanf("\n%c", &c);
	printf("the character is %c\n", c);

	/* Note: the newline in the scanf for a single character is needed
	 * because the %c specifier does not ignore whitespace by
	 * default.
	 */

	if (c == '&') {
		printf("the character is an ampersand\n");
	}
	else if (c == '@') {
		printf("the character is an at-sign\n");
	}
	else {
		printf("the character is not an ampersand and is not an at-sign\n");
	}

	return 0;
}
```

What happens when an invalid integer is entered in the above program?
Write this in a comment.

Modify the above code to compute a result in a new variable based on
the character. For example, if the user enters a `*`, compute and
print `x * y`. Do this for the operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`. If
an unkown operator is entered, print an error message.

You will have to write a conditional `if` statement to do
this. Use the `if` statement in the example as a guidline.

### Example Output
Make the program output look like the following:

```
$ ./part6
enter first number:
11
enter second number:
22
enter an operator:
+
11 + 22 is 33

$ ./part6
enter first number:
16
enter second number:
137
enter an operator:
*
16 * 137 is 2192

$ ./part6                      
enter first number:
10
enter second number:
3
enter an operator:
%
10 % 3 is 1

$ ./part6
enter first number:
1
enter second number:
2
enter an operator:
#
Unknown operator #
1 # 2 is 0

```

(In the above, the `$ ./part6` shows the program being started. You
don't have to print this from inside your program.)

When you are done with this part make sure git tracks this file. Run following command form inside lab02 folder:
```
git add part6.c
```

## Submission procedure

You have to "commit" changes you made in the assignment. In order to do that run:

```
$ git commit -am "Write some submission message here"
```

This will only update your local repository, meaning that nothing will be updated on github. You have to "push" your changes in order to do that:

```
$ git push origin master
```

Make sure you didn't receive any errors in the output.

You can check the organization page on github for correct submission. Go to your own assignments repo, and make sure all the files are updated with the changes you made.

## Grading Rubric

Parts 1-5 are worth 10 points each. Part 6 is worth 30 points.

For each part, the rubric is:


```
Program compiles                       : 10%
Program compiles with no warnings      : 10%
Some output generated                  : 10%

Correct output                         : 40%
Quality of explanation in comment      : 30%


Total : 100%
```

You will receive *at most* 10% if your program does not compile. You
will receive *at most* 20%if your program compiles with warnings.

You will lose 20% if you do not put your name in a comment near
the top of the program.
