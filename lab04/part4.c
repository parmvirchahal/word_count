/* This program reads an integer and prints its square root. It initially checks
 * if the integer that is input is positive or negative and exits the program if
 * it is the latter. If the integer is positive, the program calls the mysqrt
 * function. In mysqrt, epsilon is set to 0.00001 and guess is assigned to 1.0.
 * This function, however, calls another function, absolutevalue, to calculate
 * the absolute value of any input integer. In mysqrt, while the absolute value
 * of guess * guess â€“ x (the originally input integer) is greater than epsilon,
 * guess is assigned to the value of the originally input integer divided by
 * guess + guess, all divided by 2.0. The program then assigns the value of guess
 * to root and prints the correct square root of the originally input integer.
